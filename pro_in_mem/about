/*
all of functions is common, there is no special in some one
so, find a address and calculate offest.
*/

.dynamic record all the information of dynamic
/*in .dynamic find type 'SYMTAB', that is the entry of .dynsym*/
.dynsym just save the symbol name which the program need.

.rel.dyn
relocate data symbol

.rel.plt
this is the recolate information of functions in share libraries. they about .got.plt
the offest is address in this program .got.plt
but in .got.plt, this address just record the running real address
from .dynsym find functions name and find offest in .rel.plt ,then, jump *(addr) to
.got.plt , there is the start real address.
